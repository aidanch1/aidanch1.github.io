# How I got into UW CS  
*July 29, 2021*

Summer 2018: I partook in a summer program offered by the UW Robinson Center, summer stretch. I took chemistry over the summer with a couple of friends. Through the program I learned about UW Academy, a way for people to enter UW after 10th grade, something which I thought was cool and kept in the back of my mind

December 2019: Applications for UW Academy were due in March, and I decided I might as well shoot my shot. If I get rejected nothing happens, and if I get in I'll have the option to go or reject, so I thought it couldn't hurt to apply. I signed up to take the SAT and ACT  

---
Feburary 2020: I got a 1520 on the SAT and 35 on the ACT, which was ok considering I didn't practice. I decided to write the application essay, ask for a few letters of rec, and send it

April 20, 2020: "Thank you for applying to the University of Washington’s Academy for Young Scholars.  We have completed our application review, and regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission to the program. As always the UW Academy’s admission process was highly competitive... We encourage you to keep the University of Washington in mind when you apply to colleges in the future." Well, I got rejected. Was that it? With the encouragement of my mom, I spent 2 hours writing an appeal, with no expectations

June 2, 2020: "Congratulations! After considering the new information that you provided as a part of your appeal, the UW Academy admissions team is pleased to be able to offer you a space in our 2020 cohort." As the school year was wrapping up, some people I knew got into UW Academy, suddenly this hit me out of the blue. I'm not sure what new information they got out of my appeal, but the email said that appealing showed persistence and initiative, so maybe what was in the appeal wasn't important, more so sending the appeal itself.

Autumn 2020 (1st quarter of college): UW academy requires you to take ACADEM 197 (a simple neuroscience class) and ENGL 199 (random writing class) and the engineering department requires you to take ENGR 101 and GEN ST 199 (seminar classes). On top of that I took CSE 143 (introduction to programming) and MATH 124 (calculus 1). To be eligible to apply for CS after year 1, you need to take Math 124, 125, and 126, so I needed to take them in my 3 consecutive quarters to be eligible. I was almost out from the start, as I missed registration and there were no spots in Math 124. Luckily, I managed to snipe a spot a few days before the quarter started through Notify UW (saved). GPA: 3.96

Winter 2021 (2nd quarter of college): I took ACADEM 198, a class meant for students to learn more about opportunities at the UW. I also took ENGR 231 (technical writing class, it sucked), Math 125 (calc 2), and Physics 121 (brutal). GPA: 3.98  

---
Spring 2021 (final quarter before application): I took Math 126 (calc 3), Econ 200 (I needed some social science credits to fulfill my CADRs, which are basically gen ed requirements that make you eligible to apply for majors), and CSE 373 and 414 (non-major DSA class, and non major databases class). GPA: 4.0  

---
In my application, I talked about working on some side coding projects during the school year, what I gained from them, and why they made me want to study CS. I also talked about doing competitive programming and being involved in the chess club.
