# Story of my first internship offer 
*Jan 20, 2020*

---
## Background: 
- Sophomore at UW, 3.97/4.0 GPA
- US citizen
- Resume: couple projects from CS classes/hackathons, and a couple hobby projects. Had some volunteering experience at a YMCA club and filled in the space with extracurricular interests
- Leetcode: 105 easy, 266 medium, 42 hard

## Results: 
I started applying late (middle of december) so many spots weren't available. 122 applications, and got the first offer on the table! ($42/hr)
I applied through the [pittcsc github repo](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships), UW handshake, and linkedin  
Takeaways: next year, apply earlier, it'll make the search easier. August is when many big companies open up their applications.
