## Results: 
I started applying late (middle of december) so many spots weren't available. 122 applications, haven't heard back from 75% of places yet, but got the first offer on the table! Super happy because its a pretty good offer too
I applied through the [pittcsc github repo](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships) and also UW handshake, with a few places on linkedin  
Takeaways: next year, apply earlier, it'll make the search easier. August is when many big companies open up their applications.
